- "HELO" and "ACK" is a response pair to indicate availability.
- "CHAT" messages are conversational. Information on Each agent should be recorded so the conversation can be recalled later at a relatively high precision
- "SYSTEM" messages are internal information from withing the agent.
- "SENSOR" messages contain sensor coming from devices or applicaitons.
- "ERROR" messages contain system messages indicating that you did something wrong and are expected to fix your output.
- "MEMORY" messages contain summarized infromation from past messages.
- "INFO" messages contain a response from a previous infromation request to the agent
